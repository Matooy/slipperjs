<h1>Structure</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Basically, component/ directory is free space for developer.<br>
But, template/ and view/ directory is reserved as default.
</p>

<pre>
▾ component/    <- Your working space.
  ▸ template/   <- Put all template files as .html
  ▾ view/       <- Put all view files as .js
    ▸ @layout   <- This directory is hidden. Unaccessable from Router.
▸ config/       <- Configurations.
▸ core/         <- Core files. Please don't touch, until the time comes!!
▸ i18n/         <- i18n files.
▸ module/       <- Extendable constructors.
▸ vendor/       <- Vendors, external libraries and etc.
</pre>


<h2>Hidden directories</h2>

<p>
All files within a directory which name is started with "@" will be ignored by Router.<br>
This means that you can hide files from basic page transition. 
<br>(Be careful. This is the Client-Side framework. It is difficult to hide all things completely.)
<br>
If you want to make partial view files, make a directory like "@~~~" and put files in it.
</p>

<p>
"@" is predefined as default. But you can change this char at <code>config/main.js</code>.<br>
