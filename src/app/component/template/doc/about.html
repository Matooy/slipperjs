<h1>About</h1>

<p>
"Slipper" is a JavaScript based framework for multi-platform application. (via Cordova)
</p>

<p>
This application's main purpose is to separate frontend developments from whole work-process.<br>
Sometimes, it is difficult to separate coding-part from data-manipulating-part in Web-Application development.
</p>

<p>
I have scripted this framework for own knowledge and frontend-engineers like me.
